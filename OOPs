 Python:
datatypes are **class** and variable of this class is **object** >>class name should bein PascalCase , variable or func name as snake_case.
Object is an instance of a class> how to create: wagon=Car() like in case of inbuilt class like list and string ,we can have like l=list() #l=[1,2,4] already makes 
,s=str() # string
Function vs Method : method L.append(1)>> method(written in list class) is a special func written inside a class ,whereas function is normal func like len(L)>>function

# 1. Encapsulation: using a class to group data and methods
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):#constructor
        self.name = name  # Public attribute #anything is executed automatically asoon as we mke an object/instance of the class like tiger=Animal()

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound.")

# 2. Inheritance: Dog class inherits from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    # 3. Polymorphism: speak method is overridden
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barks.")

# 4. Abstraction: hiding details using a simple interface
def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.speak()

# Main part
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
animal = Animal("Generic Animal")

animal_sound(animal)  # Calls Animal's speak()
animal_sound(dog)     # Calls Dog's overridden speak()

__str__ is aso called automatically executed EX:
(we are making our own datatype like fraction x=4/5 as in python it gets converted to decimal always
class Fraction:
   def __init__(self,n,d):
        self.num=n
        self.den=d
   def __str__(self):
       print("{}/{}".format(self.num,self.den)))
basically whenever we create an object to this class  fraction like x=Fraction(4,5) ,we just use x lke l=[2,5,x,6,]
print(l) or print(x) you will get 4/5
